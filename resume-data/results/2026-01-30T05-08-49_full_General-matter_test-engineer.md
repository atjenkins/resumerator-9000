# Full Job Fit Review Results

**Overall Score:** 82/100

**Fit Rating:** GOOD

## Summary
Strong technical match with extensive test engineering experience at SpaceX and robotics companies. Candidate demonstrates hands-on hardware testing, automation, and system integration skills that align well with the role. Leadership experience and ability to build test infrastructure from ground up are valuable assets. Main gaps are lack of specific nuclear/uranium industry experience and limited fluid systems background.

## Strengths
- Extensive test engineering experience (4+ years) exceeds minimum requirement
- Strong hardware development background with mechanical and electrical systems
- Proven experience building test infrastructure and automation from ground up
- Leadership experience managing test engineering teams
- Hands-on experience with data acquisition systems and instrumentation
- Python programming and automation expertise
- Experience with complex electro-mechanical systems integration
- NASA and SpaceX experience demonstrates ability to work with high-stakes, precision hardware

## Suggested Improvements
- Add specific examples of fluid system testing or design experience
- Highlight any FEA analysis experience from academic or professional work
- Emphasize experience with pumps, valves, or hydraulic systems if any
- Quantify test automation achievements and reliability improvements
- Add any experience with qualification campaigns or regulatory compliance testing
- Include specific test equipment brands/models worked with
- Highlight extended hours/deadline-driven project experience

## Missing Keywords
`finite element analysis (FEA)`, `fluid systems`, `pumps`, `valves`, `qualification campaigns`, `reliability testing`, `test fixtures`, `data acquisition systems`, `instrumentation`

## Transferable Skills
- Complex system integration from robotics/aerospace applies to nuclear hardware
- NASA standards compliance transfers to nuclear regulatory requirements
- High-reliability testing from SpaceX applies to nuclear safety requirements
- Automated test stand development directly applicable
- Root cause analysis and failure investigation experience

## Targeted Suggestions
- Emphasize experience with safety-critical systems testing from aerospace background
- Highlight any experience with pressure testing or structural validation
- Add details about test fixture design and fabrication capabilities
- Include specific examples of working with manufacturing engineers on design improvements
- Mention willingness to work extended hours and adapt to nuclear industry requirements
